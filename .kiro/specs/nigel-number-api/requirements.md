# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Nigel Number API is a Django-based REST API server that calculates the "Nigel Number" for any given positive integer. The Nigel Number is defined as the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to a given positive integer N.

## Glossary

- **Nigel Number**: The sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to a given positive integer N
- **Prime Number**: A natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself
- **API Server**: A Django-based web application that provides REST endpoints
- **Django Framework**: A high-level Python web framework for rapid development

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to send a positive integer to the API, so that I can receive the calculated Nigel Number for that integer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a GET request with a positive integer parameter, THE API Server SHALL return the Nigel Number as a JSON response
2. THE API Server SHALL validate that the input parameter is a positive integer
3. IF the input parameter is not a positive integer, THEN THE API Server SHALL return an HTTP 400 error with an appropriate error message
4. THE API Server SHALL calculate the sum of all prime numbers less than or equal to the provided integer
5. THE API Server SHALL return the result in JSON format with the original input and calculated Nigel Number

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to receive proper HTTP status codes and error messages, so that I can handle different scenarios appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid request is processed successfully, THE API Server SHALL return HTTP 200 status code
2. WHEN an invalid input is provided, THE API Server SHALL return HTTP 400 status code with error details
3. WHEN an internal server error occurs, THE API Server SHALL return HTTP 500 status code
4. THE API Server SHALL include descriptive error messages in the response body for all error cases

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API to follow REST conventions, so that it is intuitive and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API Server SHALL expose a RESTful endpoint for Nigel Number calculation
2. THE API Server SHALL accept requests at a clearly defined URL path
3. THE API Server SHALL return responses in JSON format
4. THE API Server SHALL include appropriate HTTP headers in responses
5. THE API Server SHALL support CORS for cross-origin requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to be performant and handle edge cases, so that it provides reliable service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API Server SHALL efficiently calculate prime numbers for reasonable input sizes
2. THE API Server SHALL handle the edge case where N equals 1 (result should be 0)
3. THE API Server SHALL handle the edge case where N equals 2 (result should be 2)
4. WHEN the input integer is very large, THE API Server SHALL implement reasonable performance optimizations
5. THE API Server SHALL log calculation requests for monitoring purposes
